        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rice Bowls</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooled cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced, quartered English cucumber</li>
        <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup banana pepper rings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line with parchment.</li>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <li>Combine chicken, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 teaspoon Greek seasoning, paprika, garlic, and salt in a bowl. Stir until well coated; set aside.</li>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <li>For dressing, whisk olive oil, red wine vinegar, pepper brine, honey, Dijon mustard, salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl until well combined; set aside.</li>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <li>Combine cooked rice and soy sauce with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and 1 teaspoon Greek seasoning in a bowl. Spread rice onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <li>Bake rice in the preheated oven until rice is crispy and lightly browned, about 40 minutes.</li>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, undisturbed, until chicken is browned on one side and releases easily from the pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink at the center and browned on all sides, about 4 minutes more. Add water to the skillet and continue to stir until the bottom of the skillet is deglazed. Remove from heat.</li>

        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <li>To serve, divide chicken, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, banana peppers, parsley, and olives among 4 bowls. Top evenly with crispy rice and feta cheese and drizzle with dressing.</li>
        </ol>
